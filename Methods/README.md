# Methods

__Methods Long Form__ gives a deep dive into all aspects of Genomic-ULMFiT, including data preparation, model architecture, regularization strategies, training protocols, comparisons to other methods and a summary of results. This is a great resource for anyone interested in the fine details of getting really good performance from transfer learning with language models.

__Methods in Brief__ WIP, not yet posted. This will be a shorter, more paper-like format for those familiar with the ULMFiT approach.
